# Traser Mapping Files

Welcome to the **Traser Mapping Files** repository! This project provides schema-based mapping files designed to facilitate the translation of datasets across various versions and formats using **JSONata**.

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains structured mapping files that enable seamless data transformation between different dataset versions. The mapping files ensure consistency, interoperability of datasets across into the Gateway.

## 🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and use the repository.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Git** (For cloning the repository)

### Setup

#### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
Open a terminal and execute:

```



## 📂 Project Structure
A brief overview of the project's folder structure:
```
├── maps/              # Core mapping files for dataset translations
├── utils/             # Utilities written in python
```


## 🛠 JSONata Integration
This project leverages **[JSONata](https://jsonata.org/)** for powerful, flexible data transformation. JSONata expressions allow querying and modifying datasets dynamically to ensure smooth translation between versions.
